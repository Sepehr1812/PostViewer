# PostViewer
A simple Instagram-like Android app that displays some locally generated sample posts with like and comment functionalities.

This app comprises the following features:
* Showing sample post list with their image, caption, and numbers of likes and comments on the first page. The user can like each post here.
* By clicking on each post, the user navigates to the post details page that shows the post's image, caption, number of likes, and comment list. The user can like the post or leave a comment here.
* Implement pagination functionality in post and comment lists for better loading experience and memory management.

## Architecture and Technologies
In this project, I benefited from several Android concepts and libraries, including:
* Jetpack Compose
* Coroutines
* Flows
* Room
* AndroidX Paging API
* Hilt
* Lifecycles
* Material Design

Also, I implemented this project with **MVVM** architecture utilizing **clean architecture** principles.
